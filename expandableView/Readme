 WHAT THIS WILL DO
 If u want the view controller to expand as per the data inside the
 Label data and other elements
 
 Firsty go to storyboard and then on the view controller on which u want 
 Step 1 —>  then add a [parentView(0,0,0,0)to Superview] to the viewcontroller
 Step 2 —>  then add [scrollView(0,0,0,0)to parentView] to the viewcontroller
 Step 3 —>  and add a [childView(0,0,0,0)to scrollView]
 Step 4 —>  add the elements (labels and textView)
 Step 5 —>  for a particular label , go to attribute inspector and then set the Line Break to Word Wrap and then number of lines to 0(Zero) .
 NOTE:- Please do not set height of the label , just set the leading and trailing and top constraints , so that it can expand downwards.
 Step 5 —>  please set the bottom space to desired points
 and this would show a large data on screen and also works on less and no data in label
